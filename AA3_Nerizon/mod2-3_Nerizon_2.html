      <p> Shown in this image was Hidden Love's characters, Duan Jiaxu and 
      Sang Zhi. This happened when the girl wasn't able to do her homework 
      because she left her notebook at Jiaxu's dorm. The other day, they met 
      at a place near the school and Duan Jiaxu helped Sang Zhi to finish 
      her homework. </p>
